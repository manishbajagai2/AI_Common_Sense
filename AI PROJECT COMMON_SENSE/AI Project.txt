Project Name : Wisdom
Description : 
	Wisdom is an artificial intelligence project based on humans' common sense, whose goal is to build and utilize a large commonsense knowledge base from the contributions of many thousands of people across the Web.In artificial intelligence research, commonsense knowledge consists of facts about the everyday world, such as "Lemons are sour", that all humans are expected to know. It is currently an unsolved problem in Artificial General Intelligence. Common sense knowledge also helps to solve problems in the face of incomplete information. Using widely held beliefs about everyday objects, or common sense knowledge, AI system make common sense assumptions or default assumptions about the unknown similar to the way people do. 

To add on and test this project we will add modules like pytesseract that uses voice to read out words or sentences or facts. Also we can use features like speech recognition or dummy assistant to question (ask some common sense question) and expect some replies based on built in common sense using Artificial Intelligence.
